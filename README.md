# Emotion-ray  
A Streamlit app to classify text into six emotions.

## 🌿 Future Plans
This project started as a simple experiment in emotion detection — but it’s growing into something bigger.  
Over time, I plan to expand Emotion-ray beyond prediction and into real-world automation and personalization.

### Next Steps
- ✅ **Model Improvements:**  
  Refine emotion detection using better data balance, context-aware embeddings (e.g., DistilBERT), and multilingual support.  

- 💌 **Email Automation Integration:**  
  Connect Emotion-ray with platforms like Klaviyo and ActiveCampaign to enable emotion-aware email campaigns.  
  For example, detect a user’s mood from feedback or message content → personalize email tone or timing.  

- 🧠 **Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Build a dashboard that tracks emotional trends over time — turning raw text into actionable emotional insights.  

- 🌐 **Deployment:**  
  Host Emotion-ray on Streamlit Cloud for live public demos and API accessibility.  

### Vision
To create lightweight, human-centered AI tools that make communication more empathetic — starting with emotion-aware automations.
